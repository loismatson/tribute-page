      <p>Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Germany. His father determined that young Martin would become a lawyer, so his son was educated at the University of Erhfurt and received his master's degree in 1505. Martin wasn't interested in law, but still planned to follow his father's wishes. Philosophy and theology were his true passions, and theology won out in the end.</p>
      <p>Luther was deeply concerned with how to please God, and Scripture became an increasingly important part of his life. Returning to school in a thunderstorm in 1505, the young man was nearly struck by lightning. In terror for his life, Martin made a promise to Saint Anna that he would become a monk. He left the university and entered St Augustine's monastery. Martin's father was furious at this waste of his son's education.</p>
      <p>Luther devoted his life to prayer, fasting, and confession, but he found no peace for his troubled conscience. Martin's superior, Johann von Staupitz, encouraged him to look to the merits of Christ, rather than upon his own merits, to enjoy true peace with God. Luther was ordained a priest in 1507, and two more bachelor's degrees followed. Then, in 1512, he was awarded a Doctor of Theology degree. He taught theology at Wittenburg University for the remainder of his career. From 1510 to 1520, he lectured on the Psalms, Hebrews, Romans, and Galatians. During his studies, he came to realize that justification was God's act rather than a work of man. Luther began to teach that salvation is a pure gift of God's grace, received by faith in Jesus Christ. Finally, the way to true peace with God was opened to him.</p>
      <p>Dr. Luther became increasingly concerned over the practice of the Catholic Church regarding the sale of indulgences. He insisted that forgiveness was granted by God alone, and that an indulgence would not absolve its buyer from punishment. On October 31, 1517, Luther posted his <span class="italic">Ninety-Five Theses</span> on the door of All-Saint's Cathedral in Wittenburg. He wanted to discuss these points with the leading theologians and church leaders. Instead, an uproar ensued, and Luther went head to head with the most powerful institution in Christendom. He was told to recant his writings and teachings, but Luther couldn't do that. He was branded a heretic and excommunicated on January 3, 1521. He was ordered to appear before an assembly, the Diet of Worms, for questioning and one last chance to recant. Luther's response:</p> 
        <div class="pull-quote" "italic">"Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen."

      <p>On May 25, 1521, Dr. Martin Luther was declared an outlaw, and his literature was banned. If Luther was found he would be arrested, and it was a crime for anyone in Germany to provide him food or shelter.</p>
      <p>After the Diet of Worms, on the return trip to Wittenburg, Martin Luther was "kidnapped" by his friends. He was brought to Wartburg Castle where he spent nearly a year in hiding. During his exile, Luther spent his time translating the New Testament from Greek into common German. He also wrote many doctrinal writings.</p>
      <p>Luther was an accomplished musician, and he encouraged congregational singing for worship and home. He greatly influenced the hymnody of the Church, and he authored several hymns, including the following:
        <ul>
          <li>"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God" (based on Psalm 46)</li>
          <li>"From Depths of Woe I Cry to You" (based on Psalm 130)</li>
          <li>"From Heaven Above to Earth I Come" (based on Luke 2:11-12)</li>
        </ul>
      Luther also wrote hymns based on the Ten Commandments, and for the seasons of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost. As his hymns were carried across the world, they also spread his ideas of the Reformation. Luther had this to say about music:
      </p> 
        <div class="pull-quote">"Next to the Word of God, music deserves the highest praise. The gift of language combined with the gift of song was given to man that he should proclaim the Word of God through music."
